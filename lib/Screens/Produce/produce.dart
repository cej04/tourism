The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried on around 1.2 to 3.0 metres below sea level.\n\nNorth Kuttanad comprises Vaikom taluk, western parts of Kottayam taluk, and western parts of Changanacherry taluk in Kottayam district. The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of 'The Rice Bowl of Kerala'.",

      description:
          "Rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from the rubber tree or others. The latex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called “tapping”. The latex then is refined into rubber that is ready for commercial processing. In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for marketing.\n\nOf the total natural rubber production in India, 35% is from Kottayam District. Most of India's natural rubber originates from the acres of well-kept plantations of Kottayam.  It is also home to the Rubber Board of India.",
